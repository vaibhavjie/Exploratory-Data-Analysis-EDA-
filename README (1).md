# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the given dataset to gain insights into its structure and relationships between variables. This involves data cleaning, visualization, and summarization to inform potential predictive modeling or further statistical analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `train.csv`. Ensure this file is present in the project directory before running the analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- `project02 (1).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- `train.csv`: The dataset file used for analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavjie/EDA_project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd EDA_project
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the necessary packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser. From there, open `project02 (1).ipynb` to view and execute the analysis steps.

## Analysis Steps

The EDA process in this project includes:

1. **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing inconsistencies.
3. **Univariate Analysis:** Examining the distribution of individual variables using histograms and box plots.
4. **Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
5. **Multivariate Analysis:** Analyzing interactions between multiple variables simultaneously.
6. **Visualization:** Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib for effective data visualization.
7. **Summary and Insights:** Summarizing findings and potential implications for further analysis or modeling.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- Identification of significant variables influencing the target variable.
- Detection of outliers and anomalies.
- Insights into data distributions and relationships.

For detailed analysis and visualizations, refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
